# Backup Readiness Status (BURS)

BURS helps you prepare for scheduled backups. By setting a status message schedule that is synchronized with your backup schedule you can avoid being informed after your backups have aborted that there is insufficient space on your destination/target drive.

BUR is comprised of two applications.  The first is the Setup application which guides you through the steps needed to prepare for status monitoring.   The second application performs the actual monitoring and status message display.
